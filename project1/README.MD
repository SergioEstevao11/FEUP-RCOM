# FEUP-RCOM project 1

**Description** - Data Transfer Protocol Program, using the serial port, to exchange files between two connected computers

**Course** - Computer Networks

## Project Overview

In this project, the user can exchange files, such as images, audio files, and videos, between two computers connected by an asynchronous serial port. This protocol takes into account fault-tolerance, being packet loss and packet alteration proof, making the protocol reliable and guaranteeing that the transferred file recreated in the receiving computer is identical to the original one.
